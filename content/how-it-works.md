  title: The Patient Journey
  subtitle: The natural state of the body is health. Its regulatory systems maintain
    that wellness despite occasional threats. But those systems are often impaired
    by outside factors. At Soul Spring, we help you rekindle your body's natural power
    to heal and regenerate by combining the best of biological medicine, innovative
    medical technologies, and the wisdom of ancient holistic approaches.
  features:
  - title: Holistic Diagnostics & Assessment
    image: images/power-of-biological-medicine/05.svg
    description: We begin by understanding the cause rather than focusing on the symptoms.
      Non-invasive diagnostic tests and assessments allow us to look for stressors,
      toxins, dysregulations and imbalances so we can isolate the root cause of your
      health challenges.
  - title: Personalized Therapy Plan
    image: images/power-of-biological-medicine/05.svg
    description: The results of the diagnostics and assessment provide a roadmap to
      underlying imbalances and/or dysregulations and allow the Medical Director to
      immediately start addressing your concerns. A personalized therapy plan is strategically
      created from this roadmap to address root cause(s) and deliver an integrated
      approach to your unique healing journey.

      and regeneration therapies designed to correct dysfunctional biological processes

      and integration programs may also be included in your therapy plan.
