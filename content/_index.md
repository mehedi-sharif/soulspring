  faq_list:
  - title: How is Soul Spring different?
    content: 'Soul Spring is a one-of-a-kind bio-individualized holistic wellness
      center that goes beyond treating symptoms and helps the body naturally heal
      itself. Our innovative approach starts with non-invasive diagnostics and assessments
      which explore the deeper causes of symptoms, ailments, and chronic health conditions.
      Bio-individualized detoxification and regeneration therapies are then designed
      to regenerate the body and awaken its innate healing abilities. '
  - title: What is it going to cost me?
    content: "The cost of the non-invasive diagnostic tests, assessment and initial
      consultation is $250. \n\nThe total cost of your wellness journey is determined
      by the therapies designed specifically for you. Most clients invest $1,200-$2,500
      in their healing journey with us over the first 3 months. \n\nOnce your Personalized
      Therapy Plan has been developed, we are happy to discuss the various packages
      and payment plans we offer. "
  - title: How long before I see results?
    content: "Each client’s wellness journey is different. Our bio-individualized
      therapies provide a holistic pathway for your body to experience relief, healing,
      and rejuvenation as quickly as possible.  \n\nWhile a vast majority of our clients
      feel the immediate benefits and alleviation of many symptoms, most therapy plans
      are implemented over a 3–6-month period. Please know we will be with you throughout
      your journey, helping you to improve your overall well-being.  "
  - title: Do you accept insurance?
    content: 'Soul Spring Centers are primarily cash pay centers and not contracted
      with insurance; therefore, we are unable to accept any form of medical insurance
      or Medicare/Medicaid.  '
  - title: What can I do if no location is close to me?
    content: 'You are welcome to visit our residential locations or plan a 2.5-5 day
      visit using our “Outstation Client Packages.” All our locations have a substantial
      number of clients who fly in from outstation, including overseas, for their
      healing journeys with us.  '
  - title: Can treatment happen before illness, not after?
    content: "With the onset of new diseases and chronic conditions, it is important
      to move from conventional, reactive care to preventative, regenerative care.
      \n\nSoul Spring's bio-individualized therapies are dynamic alternatives to conventional
      medicine. We can help restore and rejuvenate the natural healing capacity of
      your body's cells and organs, creating a stronger, more resilient you."
  - title: Can therapies be customized, not customary?
    content: "To optimize heath and restore balance, it is important to understand
      that each person's stress factors are different - leading to the need for personalized
      therapies and treatments. \n\nSoul Spring's non-invasive diagnostic tests and
      assessments provide a roadmap to underlying imbalances and/or dysregulations
      in your body. A personalized therapy plan is strategically created from this
      roadmap that includes bio-individualized therapies designed for your unique
      healing journey."
  - title: Can health solutions be ancient, not obsolete?
    content: "Soul Spring combines the wisdom of natural medicine with cutting-edge
      technology to create a holistic wellness experience designed around you.\n\nBacked
      by 20+ years of clinical research and development, our bio-individualized therapies
      and protocols stimulate the innate healing ability of your body, enabling detoxification
      and rejuvenation of your body’s cells and organs. \n"
  - title: Can detoxification begin inside, not outside?
    content: |-
      Conventional medicines and drugs are increasingly proving to have short-term effects on illness, without treating the root cause. To deal with lifestyle issues, chronic conditions and environmental complications, the focus needs to shift to detoxification and rejuvenation from within.

      Soul Spring’s personalized therapy plans include detoxification and regeneration treatments designed to eliminate toxins, stressors, and imbalances within the body, restoring and strengthening the body’s natural ability to heal itself.
